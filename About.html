        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Rank is a social service organization started in the year of 2016 to commemorate the respect to the founder of my most inspired company I was working for. It was set up on the 1st of JULY 2016 to tackle the problems of poverty and orphanages in Coimbatore and the surroundings.
                The RANK’s main objective is to provide high-quality services to poor children for their basic-educational and other essential needs. Education aid & support to Government schools, Child care development programs. Donating Blood in emergencies. Tree Plantation. Free food and clothes distribution to unprivileged children and sponsor living and medical expense of destitute and abandoned senior citizens.
                Rank’s sole objective is selfless services for needy people and not for making any profits in any form.
                Our logo of flying hands symbolizes RANK is dedicated to service to humanity.
                Our vision is widespread in which every child can look forward to a new day, children and old aged are free of hunger.
